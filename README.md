Hitech Crime Single 'Autumn'

OCTILARY - CHILL TRAP BEAT

bring it on
my mind needs to fucking grow ya
my mind needs fucking grow 
my mind needs to grow
how can all this feel so cold
please tell me you don't know x2

Don't be fooled by that cruel world
Don't you be fooled

—-

[VERSE 1]
my mind wants to grow (5)
my mind needs and craves that endless growth (9)

don't you fly on fake years (6) -
don't you fuss - what to smoke, dope (6)
crystal never clear, put your luck to use 
don't be drawn into the void, never fear
and never lose

always queue your people close
ascend when your enemy is present, 
it’s a dance angst - never let it drop, build it up in fever, cash it out then flop - in a trance for a week
wait it out and return with vengeance

—-
 
box of contention empire of hope
for the ultimate end until rejection

never fear objection



don't you paint this world so cold ya






Don't be by this cruel fucking world
This world feel so cold
Feeling so slow ya
